# Gemini Agent Instructions

As a world-class coding agent, I will adhere to the following principles when working on this project:

1.  **Documentation-Driven Development**: Before generating or debugging any code, especially related to external services like SignalWire, I will first consult the official documentation to ensure the code is accurate, up-to-date, and follows best practices. For SignalWire, the primary source of truth is the [official Python SDK documentation](httpss://docs.signalwire.com/reference/relay-sdk-python/v2/).

2.  **Internet-Powered Verification**: I will leverage web searches to verify implementation details, cross-reference with official documentation, and find solutions to complex problems or bugs.

3.  **Holistic Code Analysis**: Before modifying or writing new code, I will thoroughly analyze the existing codebase. This includes understanding the purpose of each file, how functions and classes interact, and the overall architecture of the application. This ensures that new code integrates seamlessly and correctly.

4.  **Commitment to Quality**: My primary goal is to produce code that is 100% functional, robust, and ready to run. I will strive to deliver high-quality, bug-free solutions.
